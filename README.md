# Diabetes Patients Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on a set of health-related features. The goal is to create a tool that can assist in early detection and intervention, potentially improving patient outcomes. The model utilizes a classification approach, leveraging patient data to identify individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database**. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and is available on platforms like Kaggle. It comprises several medical predictor variables (Pregnancies, Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age) and one target variable (Outcome), indicating whether a patient has diabetes.

## Analysis Steps

The following steps were undertaken in this analysis:

1.  **Data Loading and Exploration:**
    * Loaded the dataset using pandas.
    * Performed initial exploration to understand the structure of the data, including the number of rows and columns, data types, and basic statistics.
    * Checked for missing values and duplicates.

2.  **Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handled missing values (if any) using appropriate techniques (e.g., imputation with mean or median).
    * Explored the distribution of features and identified potential outliers.
    * Performed feature scaling using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model training process.

3.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    * Visualized the distribution of individual features using histograms and box plots.
    * Examined the relationship between features and the target variable using bar plots and scatter plots.
    * Calculated the correlation matrix to understand the linear relationships between different features.

4.  **Model Selection and Training:**
    * Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing) using `train_test_split` from scikit-learn.
    * Implemented and trained a **Logistic Regression** model using the `LogisticRegression` class from scikit-learn.
    * Optionally, another classification model like **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** was also implemented and trained for comparison.

5.  **Model Evaluation:**
    * Made predictions on the testing set using the trained model(s).
    * Evaluated the performance of the model(s) using appropriate classification metrics:
        * **Accuracy:** The overall correctness of the predictions.
        * **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
        * **Precision:** The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
        * **Recall:** The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
        * **F1-Score:** The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
    * The **Logistic Regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 79%** on the test set.

6.  **Model Interpretation (Logistic Regression):**
    * Examined the coefficients of the Logistic Regression model to understand the importance and direction of the relationship between each feature and the likelihood of diabetes.

## Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome

* **Missing Values:** The dataset contained some instances of missing values (represented as 0 in certain columns like Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI). These were handled by [Specify your imputation method, e.g., replacing them with the mean or median of the respective column] to avoid losing valuable data.
* **Feature Scaling:** The features in the dataset had different scales, which could negatively impact the performance of some machine learning algorithms. This was addressed by applying `StandardScaler` to standardize the features.
* **Model Selection:** Initially, multiple classification models were considered. Logistic Regression was chosen as a primary model due to its interpretability and good performance on this type of binary classification problem. SVM was also explored as an alternative.
* **Class Imbalance:** [Mention if there was a significant class imbalance in the dataset (number of diabetic vs. non-diabetic patients) and how you addressed it, if applicable (e.g., using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or class weights)].

## Instructions on How to Run the Code

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * pandas
    * numpy
    * scikit-learn
    * matplotlib
    * seaborn

    You can install these libraries using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```

2.  **Running the Notebook:**
    * Download the `Diabetes_Patients_Predictions.ipynb` file.
    * Ensure the `diabetes.csv` dataset (or the dataset you used) is in the same directory as the notebook, or provide the correct path to the dataset in the notebook.
    * Open the `Diabetes_Patients_Predictions.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
    * Run the cells sequentially to execute the data analysis and model training pipeline. The output of each step, including the model accuracy, will be displayed below the corresponding code cell.

## Code Comments

The code within the `Diabetes_Patients_Predictions.ipynb` notebook is thoroughly commented to explain each step of the data loading, preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation process. The comments aim to provide clarity on the logic and purpose of each code block, making it easy to understand the implementation.
